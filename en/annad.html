    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am born and raised in Ísafjörður, a small rural town in the Westfjords of Iceland. I'm married with two daughters born in 2007 and 2009. My wife is an artist from Serbia and one of our biggest dreams is to have a house in the countryside and live off the land and do what we love, ie program, make music and art.<br>
      <br>
      I have always been a hard worker and a complete finisher. I'm a really quick learner and don't need long to adapt to new environments. A good example of that would be a music programming course (Max/MSP) I attended at the art academy, before I had any programming knowledge at all. The teacher of that course had me tutor the other students at the end of that course, I had gotten such a good hold of Max (the result of the course was a program I named Le Grande, which can be found <a href="http://www.sevenoi.com/?page_id=82">here</a>).
      <br>
      I am also very stubborn and don't give up if I hit walls. I am, though, quite realistic as well, so I can very well realize if the wall is worth breaking through.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Music</strong> is everything from a hobby to a passion to my job, when I have paid projects (which come along and are mostly modern dance related).<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Programming</strong> could have the same description as music, really. My brain always goes into programming mode in my daily life when trying to figure out various problems.<br>Music-related programming and web-programming are most interesting for me (especially music programming, as it combines two passions) but I also enjoy improving my efficiency with scripting etc. I've also been quite attracted to more visual- and game-programming lately.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Animation</strong> has a special place in my mind. I find that a well animated and written cartoon can be a very rewarding and creative experience to watch.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Comics</strong> are also a favourite, whether it's reading them or writing small and stupid ones.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Electronics</strong> have "sparked" my interest for a while and I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbYsPigF2bg&amp;list=UU8WdfliuaNW7_gK1VWxvxHQ">messing around with Arduino.</a><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Making musical instruments</strong> is fun and I have made a few <a href="https://vimeo.com/946959">hank drums.</a><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Video editing</strong> is also fun and I have <a href="https://vimeo.com/sevenoi/videos">messed around with that</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Photography</strong> is of course on the list as well, but who doesn't enjoy that?<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Tech geekiness</strong>, and especially related to music, is always something I keep track of. I am a member of IEEE, just to get news of developments in technology and to get more access to articles related to that.<br>
      <br>
      I could count many more things, but this should do for now...<br>
